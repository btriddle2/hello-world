# hello-world
You know, the standard dabbling
I'm the standard video game geek who really should have gotten into CS or coding, but dabbled other places. Competent with Linux, and building a gaming PC, but so much to learn about everythign else. Current focuses are going to be Python, Linux command line, and this raspberry PI I've had sitting around for far too long.
